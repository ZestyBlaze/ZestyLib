# ZestyLib
My Own Implementation of Forge Help Porting Code

# Reasoning
My reasoning for switching to this rather than Porting-Lib is a bit long and complex but to keep it short and sweet, it's basically because I don't like how much size PL adds to my mods, so I wanted a smaller, more selective portion of the tools I need for most of my ports!
Hence, ZestyLib's birth, it's overgrowing and evolving. It's purpose hopefully will be that myself and anybody else who stumbles on it can use it to help develop ports with ease and a good toolbox!

# Credits
I need to give a big shoutout to Porting-Lib. Some parts of this code come from there and this would be a lot harder without it
